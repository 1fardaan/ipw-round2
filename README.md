# IPW ROUND2

This is a Java-based calendar generator that creates a custom 37-day month calendar and exports it as a PNG image.

Unlike the traditional Gregorian calendar, this program:

- Uses 9 days per week (With the extra 2 days: Claudexday, Codexday)
- Uses 37 days per month
- Allows a custom starting weekday
- Allows a custom title
- Generates a ready-to-use calendar image file
- The program is fully implemented using Java AWT and image rendering.
